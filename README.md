# haven-of-the-dead
This is a personal game project I'm starting to help me practice what I've learned with JavaScript. 

Choose between a few heroes with base stats.

Enter the catacombs, face off against monstrous creatures and explore.

After completing a room a modal will appear summarizing the rooms events and giving you a button to take you to the next room.

The more rooms you explore the more items you discover and the more powerful you become.

But the further you travel into the catacombs... the more danger you will face.
